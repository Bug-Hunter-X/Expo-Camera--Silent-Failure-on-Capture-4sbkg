# Expo Camera Silent Failure Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where `takePictureAsync` and `recordAsync` fail silently, providing no error messages to the developer. The camera preview might display properly, leading to confusion about the root cause.

## Bug Description
The bug results in a lack of image/video capture functionality without any error handling information.  This makes debugging and resolving the issue difficult.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or EAS.
4. Try to take a picture or record a video. Observe that the app does not crash or throw any errors, but also does not capture any media.

## Solution
The solution involves using a try-catch block to handle potential errors.  While no specific errors are thrown by the Camera API in this scenario, the try-catch provides a means of capturing and reacting to unexpected behaviors, allowing for more robust error handling and providing useful feedback to the user.

## Additional Context
The silent failure might stem from permission issues (although this particular example assumes permissions are correctly handled) or underlying issues within the camera hardware or software on the device being used.  The try-catch approach is a proactive method to handle this unpredictable behavior.
